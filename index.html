                        Decision making processes, be it at the societal or at the personal level, eventually come to a point where one side will challenge the other with a why-question, which is a prompt to justify one’s stance.
                        Thus, technologies for argument mining and argumentation processing are maturing at a rapid
                        pace, giving rise for the first time to argument retrieval. We invite to participate in the first lab on <strong>Argument Retrieval</strong> at CLEF 2020 featuring two subtasks: <br> <br>(1) retrieval in a focused argument collection to support argumentative conversations; <br> (2) retrieval in a generic web crawl to answer comparative questions with argumentative results. <br> <br>
                        The <strong>(1) subtask</strong> is motivated by the support of users who search for arguments directly, e.g., by supporting their stance, and targets argumentative conversations. The task is to retrieve arguments from the provided dataset of the focused crawl with content from online debate portals for the 50 given topics, covering a wide range of controversial issues. <br> <br>
                        The <strong>(2) subtask</strong> is motivated by the support of users with arguments in personal decisions from everyday life where it comes to making choices. The task is to retrieve ranked documents from a general web crawl ClueWeb12 that help the users to answer their comparative question. We provide 50 such questions. <br> <br>

                            and disagree. Now you are looking for arguments supporting
